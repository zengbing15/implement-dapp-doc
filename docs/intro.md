# Overview

## Target users

This document site is intended for developers who have programming skills of Node.js projects for web applications. If you have basic knowledage on Nervos CKB, see [Nervos CKB Basics](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/reference/introduction) and you want to develop DApps on CKB Layer1. This document site is just for you. I hope you can immerse yourself in the wonderful world of CKB "Inception".

## Content Overview

The content is not only consist of some tutorials. You can think of it as CKB programming introduction documents. You can implement a DApp demo called Felix Bot, which can be used to send CKB red packages in Telegram chat groups. In the process of implementation, you can gradually know about the concepts and a developement tool called [Lumos](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/lumos) for developing DApps on CKB layer1. No matter how good a theory is, if you don't practice it, you will never know whether you have learned it or not. Therefore, I think such a combination of theory and practice can help you to have a deeper understanding.

In addition, you will not accept a complete overview of the Felix Bot's design ideas and concepts about CKB programming model, but takes you through the CKB world starting with a few lines of code that calls RPC. Because I am a novice myself, from my personal experience, it is easy for a novice to get confused when receiving too much information at one time, which means there is no focus. However, if you want to look through the whole thing, you can directly see [Conclusion](conclusion). In short, I hope this document can serve as a primer. If you run into any issues, please feel free to email me at [zengb@cryptape.com](mailto:zengb@cryptape.com). I truly appreciate your feedback (*^▽^*).
