# Before we Get Started

## Target Users

This document site is intended for developers who have programming skills of Node.js projects for web applications. If you want to develop DApps on CKB Layer1, this doc site is just for you. By the way, it is recommended to prepare the basic knowledage on Nervos CKB first, see [Nervos CKB Basics](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/reference/introduction). I hope you can immerse yourself in the wonderful world of CKB "Inception".

## About Content

The content is not only consist of some tutorials. You can think of it as CKB programming introduction documents. You can implement a DApp demo called [Felix Bot](felix-bot), which can be used to send CKB red packages in Telegram chat groups. In the process of implementation, you can gradually know about the concepts and a developement tool called [Lumos](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/lumos) for developing DApps on CKB layer1. 

No matter how good a theory is, if you don't practice it, you will never know whether you have learned it or not. Therefore, I think such a combination of theory and practice can help you to have a deeper understanding.

In addition, I will not provide full content about Felix Bot's design ideas and CKB programming model first, but takes you through the CKB world starting with a few lines of calling RPC code. Because I am a novice myself, from my personal experience, it is easy for a novice to get confused when receiving too much information at one time, which means there is no focus. However, if you want to look through the whole thing, you can directly see [Conclusion](conclusion). 

In short, I hope this document can serve as a primer. If you run into any issues, please feel free to email me at [zengb@cryptape.com](mailto:zengb@cryptape.com). I truly appreciate your feedback (*^â–½^*).
