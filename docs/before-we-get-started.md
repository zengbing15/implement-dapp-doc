# Before we Get Started

## Target Users

This document site is intended for developers who have programming skills of Node.js projects for web applications. If you want to develop DApps on CKB Layer1, this document site is just for you. By the way, it is recommended to prepare the basic knowledge on Nervos CKB first, see [Nervos CKB Basics](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/reference/introduction). I hope you can immerse yourself in the wonderful world of CKB's "Inception".

## Content Structure

The content is not only consist of some tutorials. You can think of it as CKB programming introduction documents. You can implement a DApp demo called [Felix Bot](felix-bot), which can be used to send CKB red envelopes in Telegram chat groups. In the process of implementation, you can gradually know about the concepts and a developement tool called [Lumos](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/lumos) for developing DApps on CKB layer1. 

No matter how good a theory is, if you don't practice it, you will never know whether you have learned it or not. Thus, I think such a combination of theory and practice can help you to have a deeper understanding.

In addition, I will not directly provide the complete content of the design idea of the felix bot and related CKB concepts, but will take you through the CKB world starting with a few lines that call RPC code. Because I am a novice myself, from my personal experience, a novice can easily be confused when TA receives too much information at once, which means no focus. However, if you want to look through the whole thing, you can see [Conclusion](conclusion). 

In short, this document site is intended to serve as the starting point for development on CKB network. If you run into any issues, please feel free to email me at [zengb@cryptape.com](mailto:zengb@cryptape.com). I truly appreciate your feedback (*^â–½^*).
